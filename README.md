# Synopsis

This is a clone of the Google homepage. It is completely responsive and accommodates all devices. Also the search bar is functional - it will redirect a users input to a real google search. The image search option is also functional and likewise will link a user to a google image search of their input.

Only pure html and css is used. A css reset is also utilized (normalize.css).

Some notable HTML/CSS techniques I utilized in this project include:
* Flex-box
* Media Queries
* Positioning - relative/absolute


##Motivation

I just finished taking Udacity's Intro to HTML/CSS (a refresher), Responsive Web Design and Responsive Images courses. This is a project I completed to practice what I learned in those two courses.

My main motivation was learning the techniques used to make a site responsive without having to rely on a library or framework.
